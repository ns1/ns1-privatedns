   - DNS: TLD zone validation currently does not allow wildcard records; this will be addressed in future versions

## 2.3.0 (Jan 31, 2020)
- New Features
   - NS1 DDNS Implementation: a filter to on-demand synthesized dynamic records from DHCP leases

- Known Issues
   - DHCP: HA settings ignore custom port for the dhcp_peers option
   - DHCP: Lease renewals do not show up in the portal
   - DHCP: Setting a new dhcp_service_def_id in a dhcp container will not update the DHCP service. Workaround: Restart the DHCP container
## 2.2.2 (Jan 10, 2020)
- What's fixed?
   - DHCP: Fixed issue where portal would not let you use a custom option type with an IP address field
   - DHCP: Fix DHCP high availability (HA) so that it properly load balances and fails over as expected
   - DHCP: Fix DHCP propagation via distribution (Dist) containers when custom options are in use
   - DHCP: Validation now prevents deleting a custom option if it’s applied to a scope group, scope or reservation; to remove a custom option, the objects using it must be modified first
   - DCHP: Fixed an issue where scopes were being removed when updated. To explicitly remove a scope from a scope group, set its scope_group_id to 0
   - DHCP: Fixed an issue where the portal would fail validating correct custom options
   - HA-Data: Running system in HA mode should no longer fill up disk
   - HA-Data: Resolved an issue where database migrations were not applied on first run and Primary flag was lost

- Known issues
   - DHCP: Custom complex options must follow specific rules for record types, added to article "Managing custom DHCP Options" (https://help.ns1.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040708334-Managing-custom-DHCP-options)
   - DHCP: Option schemas are not displayed in scope’s metadata side pane of the portal
   - HA-Data: Data container Web UI is not displaying correctly in clustered mode
   - DHCP: Reservations cannot be updated after creation; the workaround is to create the reservation with all options and settings desired via the API
   - DHCP: Reservations created in the portal do not display DHCP options and other settings; workaround is to add options and other settings when creating the reservation via API call
   - DHCP: Custom options with an array of integers cannot currently be applied in the portal; a workaround is to apply an array of integers to a scope group, scope or reservation by the API
   - DHCP: Custom options with a hex data type is currently not supported; this data type will be replaced with binary data type in a future patch version and hex data types will be effectively deprecated

   - DHCP: optiondef api allows you to delete a custom option even if it is in use
   - DHCP: HA does not sync properly resulting in split brain
   - DHCP: HA can not be set up via container UI
   - DHCP: It is not possible to remove custom options using the UI
   - AD RBAC: AD user is able to observe IPAM and DHCP pages even if assigned Team mapped to AD group does not have permissions for IPAM and DHCP
   - DNS: Failed zone import keeps the zones in the system

## 2.1.1 (Sept 20, 2019)
- What's fixed?
   - (NS1 portal) View lease information via the portal (previously viewable via API only).

   - API calls for uploading zone files with the async option enabled (i.e. ?async=true) return an internal server error.

## 2.1.0 (Aug 19, 2019)
- What's New?
   - For the latest Installation & Setup Guide, visit: https://help.ns1.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034124053
   - Renamed `web` to `core` container
   - Renamed `cache` to `dist` (distribution) container to disambiguate its function
   - Increased password complexity requirements
   - Enhanced security for API key secrets
   - Added new database layer for increased capacity and protections for referential integrity
   - Extended portal navigation to include IPAM and DHCP pages
   - Added ability to create and manage IP address objects including split, merge, bulk delete
   - Added ability to search and filter subnets
   - Added IPAM user-defined metadata in the form of tags and custom attributes
   - Added ability to create and modify DHCP server and scope settings and options
   - Added view and manage permissions for IPAM and DHCP
   - Improved performance of container configuration daemon to reconfigure in seconds
   - Added support for customized data replication across networks
- Known Issues
   - A zone in two or more networks cannot be re-pooled; the workaround is to delete the zone and recreate it with new network pool value(s); zones in a single network pool can be re-pooled without this workaround
   - A /32 or /128 host currently assigned with a reservation cannot be deleted from the IPAM interface; the workaround is to delete the corresponding reservation first before deleting the address objects
   - Container configuration web interface: Configuration lists do not allow reconfiguration; instead of using the web interface to modify these lists, the workaroud is to use the CLI or HTTP REST API configuration (e.g. docker exec -it dns supd run --data_service_defs 1-10); this is applicable to lists of data_peers in the data container and data_service_defs in the dns and dist containers.
   - Multiple scope groups should not be assignable to a single DHCP service. If this action is taken, the DHCP service (Service Definition) will be returned multiple times in the dropdown for scope & reservation assignment and or when editing settings on the DHCP service.
   - Creating a zone w/o a service group or corresponding DNS pool existing returns a 500 error; workaround the limitation by creating a service group, associating it with the organization, and defining a DNS pool.
   - Automatic bootstrap default operator username has invalid characters; workaround the limitation by removing capitalization for the operator's username before submitting the form.
